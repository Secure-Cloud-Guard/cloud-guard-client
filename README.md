# ☁️ Cloud Guard

The Cloud Guard project addresses the critical issue of data security in cloud storage, where data is hosted on third-party servers. While various data encryption methods are commonly used, cloud service providers still have access to unencrypted data. This project aims to propose a solution for securing data in cloud storage to prevent unauthorized access by providers while minimizing the overhead associated with data encryption and decryption at the user's side. 🛡️💾
